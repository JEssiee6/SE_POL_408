## Millions of people have been placed at risk of death since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Researchers and clinicians have been working hard to develop the vaccine. However, it is impossible for every vaccine to be perfect or successful for everyone. People are likely to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 vaccine. The worst result is death. This project explores whether the life of a candidate is dangerous once he or she takes the COVID-19 vaccine. This project explores if variable DIED can be predicted using various features, including age, sex, vaccine manufacturer, and so on.
## This project uses Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest in the analysis. The results suggest that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is very low. The Random Forest achieves the best predictions of the probability of death. The most important variable in the Random Forest is age.
